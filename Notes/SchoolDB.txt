What is Entity Framework ?

Official Definition: “Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.


most likely the DBContext and entity classes (model) in this Project were created using
the scaffold command which is the same process as reverse engineering
with EF Power Tools.

Once you loose the table , the DBContext no longer work. You cannot just
recreate the table and expect the DBContext to connect to it. It does not
work that way.

You will have to recreate the POCO classes and DBContext

through the scaffold  command or reverse engineer it.
